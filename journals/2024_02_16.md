- [The Tail at scale](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/classes/sp18/cse291-c/post/schedule/p74-dean.pdf)
	- Tail-tolerant techniques
	- Why Variability Exists: Shared resources,Daemons,Global resource sharing, Maintenance activities,Queueing, Garbage collection, Energy management.
	- Component-Level Variability Amplified By Scale
	- These techniques often require careful tuning and a deep understanding of the system's workload and behavior to implement effectively
	- techniques:
		- redundancy, where multiple replicas of a task are executed to take the result from the fastest one;
		- hedged requests, which send the same request to multiple servers and use the first response received;
		- micro-partitions to break down tasks into smaller, more manageable pieces; and
		- different forms of batching to reduce overhead.
		- **Timeouts and Retries**
		- **Load Balancing and Adaptive Routing**
		- **Caching**
