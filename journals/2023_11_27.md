	- corridor coaching
		- Corridor coaching, also known as "curb side" coaching, is ==a type of coaching that happens in the moment, when the need arises==. For example, a manager might have a corridor conversation with an employee to answer a question, provide feedback, or check the validity of an approach.
		- Corridor coaching is based on the idea that brief conversations can be good coaching conversations if delivered skillfully. Coaching is a collaborative process that involves listening, questioning, supporting, and challenging. It's based on a trusting relationship and facilitates thinking and reflecting.
		- Some keys to a coaching conversation include:
			- Approaching it from a place of positivity
			- Being collaborative
			- Being supportive
			- Having a judgment-free mindset
			- Focusing on the big picture impact
		- Some steps of the coaching process include:
			- Knowing where you are
			- Establishing goals and plans
			- Laying out your plans
			- Executing the action plan
			- Reaching your goal
