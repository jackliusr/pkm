- [How Netflix Ensures Highly-Reliable Online Stateful Systems](https://www.infoq.com/presentations/netflix-stateful-cache/#:~:text=At%20Netflix%2C%20we've%20used,Fewer%20bytes%20is%20more%20reliable.) #inbox
	- why nines are insufficient
		- failure modes
			- fails just a little bit all the time, it never recovers: request hedging, or improving our tests to cover some bug
			- occasionally fails cataclysmically. When service B fails, it recovers quickly but it still has a near 100% outage during that period.: load shedding or backpressure techniques
			- rarely fails, but when it does fail, it fails for a really long time: alerting or failover support, bulkhead
	- reliable stateful server
		- sharding, capacity planning, rapid responses via rapid upgrades,
		- do not share caches or datastores
		- Service Capacity Modeling, automatic capacity planning
			- workload models
			- tier-3 datastores: save money on tier-3s, and tier-2s, spend it on our tier-0s. tier-0 datastores are overprovisioned relative to expected workload.
	- reliable stateful client
		- signaling: At Netflix, we've used LZ4 compression from our stateful clients to compress large payloads before they're sent. In practice, this reduces bytes sent by between 2x and 3x. Fewer bytes is more reliable.
		- service level objectives per namespace and access pattern,
		- hedged requests,
		- exponential backoff,
		- load unbalancing, and
		- concurrency limits
	- reliable stateful API
