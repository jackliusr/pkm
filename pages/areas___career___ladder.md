		- the area where product leaders get stuck as there is no way to see that they are growing. However, if they evaluate it from the new lens, it’ll become more evident that they are growing but on a different dimension (i.e., *PSHE*).
- [Engineering Levels at Honeycomb: Avoiding the Scope Trap](https://www.honeycomb.io/blog/engineering-levels-at-honeycomb)
	- career progression happens over wider areas of both scope *and* ownership.
		- Scope progresses from focusing on tasks to features to projects, products, and the company as a whole.
		- Ownership progresses from focusing on the execution of work to the process of delivering work, to the discovery of solutions to deliver, to the discovery of problems to solve.
	- The engineering job ladder v2
		- Engineering ladder diagram: a “terminal level” for us, which sounds extreme, but it just means "you don’t have to advance beyond this level." While our ladder continues above the senior level, many very talented engineers stay at H5 because they are happy and still create the impact at Honeycomb that leaves them fulfilled. But for engineers at lower levels, there is an expectation of growth rooted in the support, coaching, mentorship, and sponsorship to realize their growth potential.

		- Growth framework based on scope & ownership: The other visualization depicts our new growth framework based on scope and ownership. We wanted to communicate that each level on the ladder is a superset of the previous levels and that there are a variety of ways to operate at any given level.

	- People want to   *make*   decisions rather than execute them
		- [To Have Control Over or to Be Free From Others? The Desire for Power Reflects a Need for Autonomy](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0146167216634064)
		- three qualities that contribute most to workplace satisfaction and overall productivity are **autonomy**, **mastery** & **purpose**.
		- “Management = autonomy” bug
	- Implementers, Solvers, and Finders
		- Solution Implementer: most of your time is simply closing tickets, and your team rarely considers your input
		- Problem Solver: Are you given general problems and left to your own devices on how they’re fixed? When brainstorming, is your input considered by your teammates. Solvers need to learn how to evangelize their favorite solutions and defend them against other Solvers who have different preferences.
		- Problem Finder: Are you given near-total autonomy in choosing what you work on? Can you tell your boss “That’s an interesting idea but my time would be better spent elsewhere” (and *not* get fired on the spot)? considered experts in their chosen domain (and are prudent about others)
