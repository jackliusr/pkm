- PCI DSS provides a baseline of **technical** and **operational** ==requirements== designed to protect account data
- Principal PCI DSS Requirements
  | PCI Data Security Standard â€“ High Level Overview | |
  | Build and Maintain a Secure Network and Systems     | 1. Install and Maintain Network Security Controls <br />2. Apply Secure Configurations to All System Components. |
  | Protect Account Data | 3. Protect Stored Account Data. <br />4. Protect Cardholder Data with Strong Cryptography During Transmission Over Open, Public Networks.|
  | Maintain a Vulnerability Management Program | 5. Protect All Systems and Networks from Malicious Software. <br />6. Develop and Maintain Secure Systems and Software. |
  | Implement Strong Access Control Measures | 7. Restrict Access to System Components and Cardholder Data by Business Need to Know <br />8. Identify Users and Authenticate Access to System Components <br />9. Restrict Physical Access to Cardholder Data.|
  | Regularly Monitor and Test Networks | 10. Log and Monitor All Access to System Components and Cardholder Data. <br />11. Test Security of Systems and Networks Regularly.|
  | Maintain an Information Security Policy | 12. Support Information Security with Organizational Policies and Programs|
- Account Data, Cardholder Data, and Sensitive Authentication Data
- Account Data
	- Cardholder Data includes:
		- Primary Account Number (PAN)
		- Cardholder Name
		- Expiration Date
		- Service Code: **Three-digit or four-digit value in the magnetic-stripe that follows the expiration date of the payment card on the track data**. It is used for various things such as defining service attributes, differentiating between international and national interchange, or identifying usage restrictions.
	- Sensitive Authentication Data includes:
		- Full track data (magnetic-stripe data or equivalent on a chip)
		- Card verification code
		- PINs/PIN blocks
- Account Data Element Storage Requirements

- terms:
	- sensitive authentication data (SAD)
	- cardholder data (CHD)
	- cardholder data environment (CDE)
	- Payment Application Data Security Standard (PA-DSS): replaced by SSF
	- Software Security Framework (SSF): consists of the Secure Software Standard and the Secure Software Lifecycle (Secure SLC) Standard
