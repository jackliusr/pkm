- `Janka Values`: the amount of pound-force that is required to partially embed a small steel ball into the surface of the wood.

- `Modulus of Rupture`: frequently abbreviated as `MOR`, (sometimes referred to as bending strength), is a measure of a specimen’s strength before rupture. It can be used to determine a wood species’ overall strength; unlike the modulus of elasticity, which measures the wood’s deflection, but not its ultimate strength.
- iwcs:
- IWCS sample size: Preferred wood size is standard IWCS sample size of **6″ x 3″ x 1/2″** (that is, six inches long, three inches wide, and a half inch thick)
- Honeycomb:  like surface or end checks, is **caused by a tension failure across the grain of the wood**, and it usually occurs in the wood rays. It is often an extension of a surface check. The wood is literally tearing itself apart.
- dimension shrinkage
	- **volumetric shrinkage**

	- tangential to radial shrinkage ratio, T/R ration: to measure the *uniformity* of the shrinkage, and is another good indicator of a wood’s stability. Ideally, a wood species with good stability would have both low volumetric shrinkage and a low T/R ratio.
	- **fiber saturation point**: only once all the free water has been lost that the wood
	- **free water**: contained as liquid in the pores or vessels of the wood itself
	- bound water: trapped within the cell walls
	- **movement in service**: But not only does wood gain or lose moisture, but it will also *expand or contract* according to the magnitude of such changes; and it is this swelling and shrinking in finished wood products—often referred to as the wood’s **movement in service**—that is responsible for so much mischief and so many malfunctions in woodworking.
	- *drying*:  Below the FSP, the wood will then begin to lose moisture in the form of bound water, and an accompanying reduction in the wood’s volume will occur. At this point, the wood is no longer considered to be in the green state
	- **ovendry**: so-called because a kiln or oven is typically required to completely drive out all moisture.
	- **equilibrium moisture content (EMC)**:As the MC of wood drops below the FSP, it will continue to lose moisture until it eventually stabilizes at a value that is commensurate with the surrounding moisture in the air.
	- moisture content (MC):
	- *Goldilocks syndrome*: the wood is not too dry, (which might lead to subsequent swelling in the humid summer), and not too wet, (which might lead to checking and splitting in the dry winter). In this way, the wood is most likely to remain as close as possible to its intended size and shape
