- A cloud development environment (CDE) service for OpenShift
- devfile: `yaml`Â text files used for development environment customization. Use them to configure a devfile to suit your specific needs and share the customized devfile across multiple workspaces to ensure identical user experience and build, run, and deploy behaviours across your team.
	- **Devfile and Universal Developer Image*: You do not need a devfile to start a workspace. If you do not include a devfile in your project repository, Red Hat OpenShift Dev Spaces automatically loads a default devfile with a Universal Developer Image (UDI).
