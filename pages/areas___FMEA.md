- Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA)
	- Engineering-oriented risk analysis
	- Severity * Probability * Detectability = Risk
	- Add observability to mitigate silent failures
	- Discuss and record component level failure modes
	- Prioritize mitigation work where it will do most good
- FMEA for Web Services - Layered Responsibility
	- Product Managers and Developers – unique business logic
	- Software Platform Team – standard components and services
	- Infrastructure Platform Team – resources, regions, and networks
	- Resilience Engineering – observability and incident management
	- FMEA Spreadsheets: github.com/adrianco/slides
- FMEA Severity Mapped to Infrastructure
- FMEA Probability Per Service Request: Guess to start with, then measure in production
- FMEA Detectability: Needs an observable monitoring alert to detect a failure
- FMEA Example – Application Level
