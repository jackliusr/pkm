- Business Scenario **method**: a technique to validate, elaborate, and/or change the premise behind an architecture effort by understanding and documenting the key elements of a Business Scenario in successive iterations where:
	- Each iteration requires planning, data gathering, analysis, documentation, and review
	- Each iteration should improve one or more of the key elements
	- Iterations are repeated until your understanding is fit-for-purpose for deciding to move forward
- **Business Scenario**: The technique is used to help identify, understand, and document business needs, and thereby to derive the business requirements that the architecture development has to address. These business requirements are documented as a Business Scenario
	- A good Business Scenario is also “SMART”:
	- a uniform description of:
		- Real business problems
		- The business and technology environment in which those problems occur
		- Value streams enabled by capabilities
		- The desired outcome(s) of proper execution
		- The human and computing components (the “actors”) who provide the capabilities
- Overall Process
