		- NGO Tasks
			- A UK based engineer reported this question on Leetcode during February. It loosely goes as follows:
			- 'A Non-Governmental-Organization has N members with IDs from 1 to N. Previously, members would perform similar service activities during weekends.
			- A new rule has been put in place, with the NGO deciding to do X new types of activities. The activities performed before now have the ID of 0.
			- For **Y hours** during weekends, a group of members with consecutive member IDs are selected to perform **X new activity types**. Members not selected during that **hour** will perform the previous types of activities.
			- The NGO head needs to find the maximum number of members performing a certain activity type for every Y working hours. Write an algorithm to figure this out.'
			- Multiple respondents were rather critical of the questions wording, unsure of how to go about it, but one user in the comments suggested this solution:

		- Office Printers
			- 'An office has four floors, with each floor having four printers. A user should be able to print using any of the four printers on their floor.
			- A printer queue should not have more than N jobs.
			- There are two types of printer. Colored and B&W. The B&W printer can only print B&W jobs but the colored printer can print both coloured and B&W jobs.'
			- The question is a low level design one, and involves coding a system forÂ  queueing prints that follows these rules.
