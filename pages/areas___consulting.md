- McKinsey feedback model
	- ==a structured format for delivering feedback==. It consists of three parts:
	  collapsed:: true
		- Part A: The specific action, event, or behavior you'd like someone to change
		- Part B: The impact of that behavior, or how it made you feel
		- Part C: A suggestion for what the person could do differently next time
	- The McKinsey Feedback Model is designed to be specific, fact-based, less personal, irrefutable, and actionable. McKinsey consultants are used to receiving feedback in this format, so using it when giving feedback to a McKinsey consultant may increase the likelihood that your feedback will be heard and understood.
