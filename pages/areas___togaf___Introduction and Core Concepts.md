- 3 Core Concepts
	- 3.1 TOGAF standard: an architecture **framework**. It provides the methods and tools for assisting in the acceptance, production, use, and maintenance of an Enterprise Architecture. It is based on an iterative process model supported by best practices and a re-usable set of existing architecture assets
	- 3.2 Architecture: The fundamental concepts or properties of a system in its environment embodied in its elements, relationships, and in the principles of its design and evolution; The structure of components, their inter-relationships, and the principles and guidelines governing their design and evolution over time.
	- 3.3 many other **domains** that could be defined by combining appropriate views of the **Business**, **Data**, **Application**, and **Technology** domains.
		- many other domains that could be defined by combining appropriate views of the Business, Data, Application, and Technology domains:
			- Information Architecture
			- Risk and Security Architectures
			- Digital Architecture
	- 3.4 **ADM**

	- 3.5 Enterprise Architecture **Services**.
		- *Service Categories and Descriptors*
		- 3.5.1 Enterprise Support Services
		- 3.5.2 Design Support Services
		- 3.5.3 Development Support Services
		- 3.5.4 Requirements Elicitation and Understanding Services
		- 3.5.5 Architecture Planning Services
		- 3.5.6 Enterprise Architecture Practice Development Support Services
	- 3.6 Deliverables, Artifacts, and Building Blocks: *"Deliverable" contains "artifacts" which describe "building blocks".*

	- 3.7 **Architecture Abstraction**
		- Contextual Abstraction Level
		- Conceptual Abstraction Level
		- Logical Abstraction Level
		- Physical Abstraction Level
	- 3.8 Architecture Principles
		- **Enterprise Principles** provide a basis for decision-making throughout an enterprise, and inform how the organization sets about fulfilling its mission
		- **Architecture Principles** are a set of principles that relate to architecture work
	- 3.9 Interoperability
	- 3.10 Enterprise Continuum: a categorization for assets held in the Enterprise Repositories that provides methods for classifying assets, including architecture and solution artifacts as they evolve from generic Foundation Architectures to Organization-Specific Architectures. The Enterprise Continuum comprises two complementary concepts: the Architecture Continuum and the Solutions Continuum.
