- [Wammu](https://wammu.eu/wammu/) is a program to manage data in your cell phone such as contacts, calendar or messages. [Gammu SMSD](https://wammu.eu/smsd/) is a service to mass send and receive SMS messages. Both these are built on top of [Gammu library](https://wammu.eu/libgammu/), which provides abstraction layer to work with different cell phones from different vendors (including Nokia, Sony-Ericsson, Motorola, Samsung, Siemens, Huawei and others).
- [SMSC3](https://github.com/mdouchement/smsc3): a SMSC simulator based on SMPP3.4. It allows to fake incoming and outgoing SMS.
- [SMPP SMSC Simulator](https://github.com/melroselabs/smpp-smsc-simulator): This code was previously used in an early version of the Melrose Labs [SMPP SMSC Simulator](https://melroselabs.com/services/smsc-simulator/) service. The SMSC simulator (or SMPP simulator) is used to test an SMS application's support for the [SMPP](https://smpp.org/) protocol and to simulate the delivery of SMS.
- Short Message Peer-to-Peer (SMPP): an open, industry standard protocol designed to provide a flexible data communications interface for the transfer of short message data between External Short Message Entities (ESME), Routing Entities (RE) and Message Centres (MC).
