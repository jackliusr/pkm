	- virt-launcher
	- virt-host-validate
	- virt-api-server
	- libvirtd: An instance of `libvirtd` is present in every VMI pod. `virt-launcher` uses libvirtd to manage the life-cycle of the VMI process.
	- virt-controller: responsible for monitoring the VMI (CRs) and managing the associated pods. Currently the controller will make sure to create and manage the life-cycle of the pods associated to the VMI objects.
- VirtualMachine (VM) - StateFul VM that can be stopped and started while keeping the VM data and state.
- VirtualMachineInstanceReplicaSet (VMIRS) - Similar to pods ReplicaSet, a group of ephemeral VMIs with similar configuration defined in a template.
- VirtualMachineInstance (VMI) is the custom resource that represents the basic ephemeral building block of an instance. In a lot of cases this object won't be created directly by the user but by a high level resource
- virtctl
	- console: serial console
	- vnc: vnc
	- start
	- stop
	- ssh
	- restart
	- expose: expose as a service
- Containerized Data Importer (CDI): an utility designed to import Virtual Machine images for use with Kubevirt.
	- DataVolume (DV): DataVolumes handle the provisioning of PersistentVolumeClaims (PVCs) for KubeVirt. A custom controller watches for new DVs, and when one is discovered, starts an import process to create a new PVC into which it will import the desired content.
