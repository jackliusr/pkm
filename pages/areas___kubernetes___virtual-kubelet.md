- Virtual Kubelet is an open source [Kubernetes kubelet](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubelet/) implementation that masquerades as a kubelet for the purposes of connecting Kubernetes to other APIs. This allows the nodes to be backed by other services like ACI, AWS Fargate, [IoT Edge](https://github.com/Azure/iot-edge-virtual-kubelet-provider), [Tensile Kube](https://github.com/virtual-kubelet/tensile-kube) etc. The primary scenario for VK is enabling the extension of the Kubernetes API into serverless container platforms like ACI and Fargate, though we are open to others. However, it should be noted that VK is explicitly not intended to be an alternative to Kubernetes federation.
