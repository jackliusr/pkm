- Dynamic Site Acceleration (DSA): a set of technologies that improve the performance of dynamic websites by caching and delivering dynamic content closer to end users. DSA solutions typically use a combination of the following techniques:
	- Content caching: cache dynamic content at edge servers located closer to end users
	- Route optimization: optimize the routing of traffic to dynamic content, avoiding congested networks and bottlenecks
	- TCP optimization: optimize TCP performance
	- Object prefetch: prefetch dynamic content that is likely to be needed by end users, even before it is requested
	- **Adaptive image compression**
