- Challenges in Async processing
	- Data loss:
		- additional standby cluster. Does all data require this? cost?
		- publish time:  lose the leader broker
			- non-keyed partitions: partition were to be unavailable because the broker is unavailable, then it automatically writes to a different partition
			- upbound of data loss:  asynchronous mode, where the publisher writes it into an in-memory queue and asynchronously publishes into Kafka
	- Processing latencies
	- Out of order and duplicate records
	- Consumer platform choice
	- Intermittent processing failures
	- Cross region routing
