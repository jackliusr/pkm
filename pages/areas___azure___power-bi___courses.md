	- DAX
		- measures, calculated columns, tables
		- [how to create measures table](https://www.phdata.io/blog/creating-a-measures-table-in-power-bi/)
			- folders
		- calculated columns: In data models for DAX, however, all calculated columns occupy space in memory and are computed during table processing.
		- measure: useful whenever you do not want to compute values for each row but, rather, you want to aggregate values from many rows in a table
		- [# Calculated Columns and Measures in DAX](https://www.sqlbi.com/articles/calculated-columns-and-measures-in-dax/): The difference is the **context** of evaluation. A measure is evaluated in the context of the **cell** evaluated in a report or in a DAX query, whereas a calculated column is computed at the row level within the table it belongs to.
