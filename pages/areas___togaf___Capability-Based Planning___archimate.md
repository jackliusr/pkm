- Active & Passive Structure
	- Active: represents the structural elements (the business actors, application components, and devices that display actual behavior; i.e., the “subjects” of activity)
	- Passive: represents the objects on which behavior is performed; these are usually **information objects** in the Business Layer and data objects in the Application Layer, but they may also be used to represent physical objects
