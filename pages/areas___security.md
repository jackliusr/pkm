	- Burp Suite Pro
	- Nessus Pro: ==a vulnerability assessment tool that helps organizations identify and fix vulnerabilities, including software flaws==. It automates vulnerability scanning and can help save time in compliance cycles.
	- YARA: a tool aimed at (but not limited to) helping malware researchers to identify and classify malware samples. With YARA you can create descriptions of malware families (or whatever you want to describe) based on textual or binary patterns. Each description, a.k.a. rule, consists of a set of strings and a boolean expression which determine its logic.
	- Metasploit Express
	- Loki: Scanner for Simple Indicators of Compromise
	- Thor: the most sophisticated and flexible compromise assessment tool on the market.
	- [Spark](https://www.sparkinstitute.org/)
	- Spark Core
	- OllyDbg 2.0: a 32-bit assembler level analysing debugger for Microsoft® Windows®. Emphasis on **binary code analysis** makes it particularly useful in cases where source is unavailable
	- IDA Pro: a disassembler for computer software which generates assembly language source code from machine-executable code. It supports a variety of executable formats for different processors and operating systems.
