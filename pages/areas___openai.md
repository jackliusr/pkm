- Assistants API: The Assistants API allows you to build AI assistants within your own applications. An Assistant has instructions and can leverage models, tools, and knowledge to respond to user queries. The Assistants API currently supports three types of [tools](https://platform.openai.com/docs/assistants/tools): Code Interpreter, Retrieval, and Function calling.

Threads store Messages and automatically handle truncation to fit content into a model’s context.</td></tr><tr><td>Message</td><td>A message created by an Assistant or a user. Messages can include text, images, and other files. Messages stored as a list on the Thread.</td></tr><tr><td>Run</td><td>An invocation of an Assistant on a Thread. The Assistant uses it’s configuration and the Thread’s Messages to perform tasks by calling models and tools. As part of a Run, the Assistant appends Messages to the Thread.</td></tr><tr><td>Run Step</td><td>A detailed list of steps the Assistant took as part of a Run. An Assistant can call tools or create Messages during it’s run. Examining Run Steps allows you to introspect how the Assistant is getting to it’s final results.</td></tr></tbody></table>
