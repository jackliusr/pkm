- 3 properteis of access patterns
	- data size
	- data shape
	- data velocity
- table class

	- facet:  represent an application's different data access patterns for Amazon DynamoDB. Facets can help you visualize your data model when multiple data types are represented by a sort key. Facets give you a way to view a subset of the data in a table, without having to see records that don't meet the constraints of the facet. Facets are considered a visual data modeling tool, and don't exist as a usable construct in DynamoDB, as they are purely an aid to modeling of access patterns.
