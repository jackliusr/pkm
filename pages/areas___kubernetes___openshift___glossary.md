- **DeploymentConfig**: objects add the additional features of **change triggers**, which are able to automatically create new versions of the `Deployment` objects as new versions of the container image are available, or other changes.
- **Build**: the process of transforming input parameters into a resulting object. Most often, the process is used to transform input parameters or source code into a runnable image. A `BuildConfig` object is the definition of the entire build process.
- **Project**: a Kubernetes namespace with additional annotations
- `OperatorGroup`: An *Operator group*, defined by the `OperatorGroup` resource, provides multitenant configuration to **OLM**-installed Operators. An Operator group selects target namespaces in which to generate required RBAC access for its member Operators.
- *security context constraints* (SCCs)
- openshift-state-metrics exporter (OSM):==an add-on agent that adds metrics for OpenShift Container Platform-specific resources==. It builds on the kube-state-metrics exporter agent (KSM), which converts Kubernetes objects into metrics that Prometheus can use.
