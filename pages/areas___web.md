- **Channel Messaging**: The **Channel Messaging API** allows two separate scripts running in different browsing contexts attached to the same document (e.g., two IFrames, or the main document and an IFrame, two documents via a [`SharedWorker`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SharedWorker), or two workers) to communicate directly, passing messages between one another through two-way channels (or pipes) with a port at each end.
