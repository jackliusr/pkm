- 2016 Letter to Shareholders
	- preventing Amazon from slipping into “stasis,” “irrelevance” or “painful decline ... followed by death.”
	- skepticism around “proxies,” such as market research as a proxy for customers; the willingness to jump on powerful, external trends; and the openness to “disagree and commit” — that is, to fully support decisions you don’t necessarily agree with after a thorough discussion in which all sides are heard.
	- a starter pack of essentials for **Day 1 defense**: customer obsession, a skeptical view of proxies, the eager adoption of external trends, and high-velocity decision making.
	- True Customer Obsession
	- Resist Proxies
	- Embrace External Trends
	- High-Velocity Decision Making
- High-Velocity Decision Making
	- advices:
		- Don’t use a one-size-fits-all decision process. Many reversible decisions are not a big deal if you’re wrong, so keep the process lightweight for them.
		- Make decisions with 70% of the information you wish you had. If you wait for 90%, you’ll probably end up being too slow.
		- Being wrong is often not as costly as you think, provided that you are good at detecting this quickly and then course-correcting.
		- Be prepared to disagree and commit, especially when you have conviction on the direction but a lack of consensus on the particular solution.
		- Recognize true misalignment issues — i.e. fundamentally different objectives and views —early and escalate them immediately
