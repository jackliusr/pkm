- [Nmstate](https://nmstate.io/) is a library with an accompanying command line tool that manages host networking settings in a declarative manner. The networking state is described by a pre-defined schema. Reporting of current state and changes to it (desired state) both conform to the schema.
- Nmstate is aimed to satisfy enterprise needs to manage host networking through a northbound declarative API and multi provider support on the southbound. NetworkManager acts as the main (and currently the only) provider supported.
