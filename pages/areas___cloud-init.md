- [NoCloud](https://cloudinit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/datasources/nocloud.html): The data source NoCloud is a flexible datasource that can be used in multiple different ways. With NoCloud, the user can provide user data and metadata to the instance without running a network service (or even without having a network at all). Alternatively, one may use a custom webserver to provide configurations.
