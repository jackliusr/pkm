	- The **Topic Tree**: The Topic Tree is a data structure used to solve the challenges posed by the above wildcard topic matching problem. The topic of the published message is used to collect the matching subscriptions present in the topic tree. We start at the root of the topic tree and proceed through its levels using the topic segments to select the next node. If the current node has wildcard subscriptions (with # or +),  they are added to the matching subscriptions. Once there are no more segments to match in the topic and there are non-wildcard subscriptions in the current node, there are exact subscriptions for this topic. An exact subscription filters topics of published messages for exact matches.
	- best practice: It is good practice to avoid topic levels that do not add additional information, like using the same topic level across all  subscriptions. The most common example of such abuse is using the company name as the first level for every subscription.
	- Last Will and Testament (LWT): When the client disconnects abruptly, the broker (AWS IoT Core) will then publish the LWT message provided by that client at connection time to all the devices which subscribed to this LWT topic.
