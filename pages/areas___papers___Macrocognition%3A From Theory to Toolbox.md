		- ShadowBox Training Method: The ShadowBox Training Method involves scenario-based instruction that allows trainees to see the world through the eyes of experts â€” without the experts having to be present. Trainees make decisions at various points in scenarios, which are created with the help of Subject Matter Experts (SMEs). Trainees are asked to rank a pre-determined set of options and provide their rationale for decisions. Finally, they review rankings and rationale provided by a panel of experts, and describe the differences between what the experts are seeing and thinking and their own choices and rationale.
