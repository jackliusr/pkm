- two properties. one for aggregated reports, another for individual sites/microsites.
- GA Migration:
	- issue in GA4:  how to manage permissions for NTUC and UNION as there is no equivalent view level permissions.
		- UA: view level permissions to unions and NTUC.
		- possible solutions:
			- multiple GA4 Configuration tags in a single Google Tag Manager (GTM) container FREE
				- properties per union (domain, subpath: microsite, landing page etc)
				- NTUC
			- google analytics 360: **Â $150,000 per year and billed at $12,500 a month**
			- other? not sure, ask Aleph
