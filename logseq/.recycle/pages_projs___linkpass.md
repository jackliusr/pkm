- UID: a universal identifier (a.k.a UID) unique across the Linkpass user base. The UID
  is generated such that it is random, time-clustered, with a low collision rate. The projected exhaustion of the UID would be more than a hundred years from now
- Association: An association is a uniquely maintained, non-revocable relationship established between Linkpass and a **pre-issued** unique user identifier within any particular digital product. An association can uniquely identify a user **both from Linkpass (once associated) as well as from the product user base**
- Membership: Membership is maintained as a revocable affiliation of the Linkpass user. These are connections that can be shared between multiple users, hence not a unique identifier for Linkpass users. Memberships are maintained such that a view of these temporary, loose links are able to provide better context about users
