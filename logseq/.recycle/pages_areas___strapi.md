- components: reusable fields that can be shared across content types. They're useful for defining a set of fields that appear in multiple places, like an address block or a rich media gallery.
- [dynamic zones](https://docs.strapi.io/dev-docs/backend-customization/models#dynamic-zones):
	- Dynamic zones create a flexible space in which to compose content, based on a mixed list of [components](https://docs.strapi.io/dev-docs/backend-customization/models#components-2).
	- Dynamic zones are explicitly defined in the [attributes](https://docs.strapi.io/dev-docs/backend-customization/models#model-attributes) of a model with `type: 'dynamiczone'`. They also accept a `components` array, where each component should be named following this format: `<category>.<componentName>`.
